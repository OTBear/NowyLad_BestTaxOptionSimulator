# NowyLad - Best Tax Option Simulator
Notebook to simulate and choose best tax option in new Polish Tax Law.
Since start of 2022, in Poland we have a "little" tax revolution, so as a part-time businnes owner I decided to create simulator for helping to choose best tax option avaliable. You just need to fill few data about your income, tax rate etc. and as a result you will get a heatmap with best tax option for your income parameters.

Vars and comments are in polish, because no one ever wil use it outside this country.

This is my first data-science related project in Python - created as easy project to learn DS.
